# Notes from SciPy 2018

## Comments and Motivation

### Overarching scientific computing review
- Community for OSS contributions
- Technical mentorship
- "Giving good advice on software is a skill."
- Include code of conduct

### Advantages for the Python community
- reproducibility of code / experiments
- "Does this actually make sense to anyone outside of the author?" / understanding
- code pairing for reviewing and for creating software

### Discoverability of packages in the scientific python ecosystem
- Listing of scikit / scientific packages + quality of packages 

### Maintenance of scientific packages over time
- response to issues and security risks 
- "Can you help me find homes for my open-source pets?" :)
- Building a community of maintainers

### Partnerships with journals 
- JOSS and Wiley 
- fast-tracking for publications (just based on paper, not code)

### Checks for scientific software packages
- Some manual; some personalized

## Concerns

### Has branding already been taken?

- GitHub repo: not in active development
- Twitter handle
- Website

## Questions

### How much of the ROpenSci stack could be leveraged for Python?
- Answer: almost of it! 
- Only a few language-specific components would be non-transferrable.
- Estimated time commitment for porting over? TBD
- Time commitment for organizers: half a day a week (Editor in Chief)

### How to do recruiting for mentors?
- average reviewer: 5 to 8 hours reviewing a package
- cannot have the same people frequently (time constraints)

### Initial funding: is it crucial for this kind of project?
- rotating editor in Chief
- 5 to 7 additional editors 

### Should PyOpenSci join ROpenSci?
- Create new Github organization
- Working collaboratively with the ROpenSci board
- Create new board of Python editors / mentors / reviewers

### What is the preservation policy of ROpenSci?
- Same policy as JOSS 

### Would there be redundancy with JOSS?
- ROpenSci = not in conflict with JOSS

### Does it make more sense to have a joint community around scientific computing standards?
- Putting a bunch of Python packages in the R stack doesn't make sense 
- But sharing community does :)

## Next Steps
- 1/2 page summary of collaboration with JOSS 
- Roadmap for timelines
- Estimation of time commitments
